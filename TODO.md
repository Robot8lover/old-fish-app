# To Do:

## Important

- Fix red joker card again, I see the border is gone.
- Fix drawing of center declares to avoid overflow (ow flexboxes and other fun things).


## Nice things for later

- Probably use an escape button for mode instead of just clicking anywhere.
- Add keybinds
- Simplify and improve color scheme
- Possibly use a different font
- Make buttons prettier
- Adjust layout for improved space
- Consider figuring out how to scale the cards (or making resized images)
- Change all "request" to "ask" or vice-versa
- Add reconnection features
- Add persistent id
- Add option to cut-off games once a winner is determined
- Probably switch to Vue
- Probably switch to TypeScript
